# Space Data Analysis Project

This repository contains code and data for scraping spaceflight data from [nextspaceflight.com](https://nextspaceflight.com/) using Python, and visualizing the results using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly in a Google Colab notebook.

## Usage

1. Open the provided Google Colab notebook ('Space_Missions_Analysis_(start).ipynb') to visualize the analysis, to view ploty plots open the notebook in Google Colab.

## Data Scraping

The `main.py` script uses Beautiful Soup to scrape data from [nextspaceflight.com](https://nextspaceflight.com/) and saves it as a CSV file.

## Data Visualization

The 'Space_Missions_Analysis_(start).ipynb' notebook in Google Colab contains code to visualize the scraped data:

- Line charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn to show trends over time.
- Interactive Plotly graphs for detailed data exploration. Note that Plotly graphs are visible only when accessing the Google Colab notebook.

## Results

The visualizations provide insights into spaceflight data trends and patterns, helping us understand various aspects of space exploration.
